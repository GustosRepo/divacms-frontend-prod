        {
          q: "How long do press-on nails last?",
          a: "With proper application and care, our premium press-on nails can last 1-2 weeks. Factors that affect longevity include nail preparation, application technique, daily activities, and exposure to water. For maximum wear time, follow our detailed application guide and aftercare tips."
        },
        {
          q: "How do I apply press-on nails properly?",
          a: "1. Clean and push back cuticles, 2. Buff nail surface lightly, 3. Clean with alcohol, 4. Select correct size for each nail, 5. Apply thin layer of included glue, 6. Press firmly for 10-15 seconds, 7. File and shape to desired length. Full video tutorial available on our blog!"
        },
        {
          q: "How do I remove press-on nails safely?",
          a: "Never force or pull! Soak nails in warm soapy water for 10-15 minutes to soften the adhesive. Gently lift from the cuticle area using a cuticle pusher. If resistant, soak longer. Apply cuticle oil afterward to moisturize your natural nails."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I reuse press-on nails?",
          a: "Yes! If removed carefully and stored properly, many of our sets can be reused 2-3 times. Clean off old adhesive with alcohol, store in the original packaging, and reapply with fresh nail glue for best results."
        },
        {
          q: "What if a nail pops off?",
          a: "Clean both the press-on nail and your natural nail with alcohol, apply a small amount of nail glue, and repress firmly. This is why we include extra glue and backup nails in our deluxe sets!"
        }

    {
      category: "Sizing & Fit",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How do I find my correct nail size?",
          a: "Each set includes 12 sizes (0-11) to fit most nail beds. Hold each press-on against your nail - it should cover your nail bed from side to side without touching your skin. When in doubt, choose the smaller size and file the sides to fit perfectly."
        },
        {
          q: "What if none of the sizes fit?",
          a: "Our sets accommodate 98% of nail sizes, but if you need custom sizing, contact us! We offer custom sizing services for an additional fee. You can also file the sides of a slightly larger nail to achieve the perfect fit."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you have sizes for very small or large nails?",
          a: "Yes! Our 12-size range includes very small (sizes 9-11) and larger sizes (0-2). We also carry XS and XL specialty sets for extreme sizing needs. Check our sizing guide for detailed measurements."

        },

          q: "How fast do orders ship?",
          a: "Orders placed before 2 PM PST ship same day! Standard shipping takes 3-5 business days. Express shipping arrives in 1-2 business days. Local LV pickup orders are ready within 2 hours."
        },
        {

          a: "Currently we ship within the US only, but international shipping is coming soon! Follow us on social media for updates on when we'll be available in your country."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I track my order?",

        },
        {

      category: "Care & Maintenance",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How do I make my press-ons last longer?",
          a: "Apply a base coat before the press-ons, avoid excessive water exposure in the first 24 hours, wear gloves for cleaning/gardening, apply cuticle oil daily, and avoid using your nails as tools. Proper prep is 80% of longevity!"
        },
        {
          q: "Can I shower with press-on nails?",
          a: "Yes! After the initial 24-hour curing period, they're water-resistant. However, avoid prolonged soaking in hot water, and gently pat dry rather than rubbing. Apply cuticle oil after long baths."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I go swimming with press-ons?",
          a: "Yes, once fully cured (24 hours). Chlorine and salt water won't damage them, but prolonged exposure may weaken the adhesive. Rinse with fresh water after swimming and apply cuticle oil."
        },
        {
          q: "What if my press-on nail chips or breaks?",
          a: "Small chips can be filed smooth. For breaks, remove the damaged nail, clean your natural nail, and apply a new press-on from your backup set. This is why our deluxe sets include extras!"

      questions: [
        {
          q: "What materials are your nails made from?",
          a: "Our premium press-ons are made from high-quality ABS plastic that's durable, flexible, and long-lasting. They're non-toxic, cruelty-free, and designed to feel lightweight and natural on your nails."
        },
        {
          q: "Are your nails safe for sensitive skin?",
          a: "Yes! Our nails and adhesive are formulated to be gentle and non-irritating. However, if you have known allergies to acrylates or adhesives, please patch test first or consult your dermatologist."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you offer custom designs?",
          a: "We love creating custom designs! Contact us with your vision and we'll work with you to create something unique. Custom orders require a 2-3 week lead time and have a minimum order requirement."
        },
        {
          q: "What's the difference between your nail collections?",
          a: "Our Y2K collection features bold metallics and futuristic designs. The Kawaii collection has cute, pastel themes with 3D elements. Our Classic collection offers timeless French tips and neutral tones. All use the same premium materials."
